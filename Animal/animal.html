                    <h1>Animal Husbandry</h1>
                    <p>Animal husbandry is the branch of agriculture concerned with animals that are raised for meat, fibre, milk, eggs, or other products. It includes day-to-day care, selective breeding and the raising of livestock. Husbandry has a long
                        history, starting with the Neolithic revolution when animals were first domesticated, from around 13,000 BC onwards, antedating farming of the first crops. By the time of early civilisations such as ancient Egypt, cattle, sheep,
                        goats and pigs were being raised on farms.

                <h4>Poultry Farming</h4>
                <p>Poultry farming is concerned with raising and breeding of birds for commercial purposes. Birds like ducks, chickens, geese, pigeons, turkeys, etc. are domesticated for eggs and meat.<br> It is very important to take care of the animals
                    and maintain them in a disease-free environment to obtain healthy food from them. The eggs and meat are a rich source of protein.<br> Sanitation and hygienic conditions need to be maintained. The faeces of birds are used as manure
                    to improve soil fertility. Poultry farming provides employment to a large number of people and helps in improving the economy of the farmers.</p>

                <h3>Bee Farming</h3>
                <p>Bee farming or apiculture is the practice of maintaining bee colonies by humans in man-made hives. Honey bees are reared on a large scale. The bees are domesticated for honey, wax, and to pollinate flowers. They are also used by other
                    beekeepers for the same purposes. The place where bees are kept is known as an apiary or a bee yard.</p>

                <p>Dairy farming is the agricultural technique concerned with the long term production of milk, which is then processed to obtain dairy products such as curd, cheese, yoghurt, butter, cream, etc. It involves the management of dairy animals
                    such as cows, buffaloes, sheep, goat, etc.<br> The animals are taken care of against diseases and are inspected regularly by veterinary doctors. A healthy animal is physically, mentally and socially sound.<br> These animals are milked
                    by hand or by machines. The milk is preserved and converted into dairy products industrially, which are then used for commercial purposes.</p>
