                    <h1>Harayana</h1>
                    <p>Attaining Statehood on November 1, 1966, Haryana hosts less than 2% of India’s population. With an area of 44.2 thousand square Km, this state occupies approximately 1.37% of the total geographical area. Barely three decades into existence,
                        Haryana has created a distinct place for itself. As the largest recipient of investment per capita since 2000 in India, and among one of the wealthiest and most economically developed regions in South Asia, Haryana has the India's
                        third highest per capita income at ₹214,509 (US$3,300) against the national average of ₹112,432 (US$1,800) in year 2016–17. Haryana's 2017- 18 estimated state GSDP of US$95 billion (52% services, 30% industries and 18% agriculture)
                        is growing at 12.96% 2012-17 CAGR and placed on the 14th position behind only much bigger states, is also boosted by 30 SEZs (mainly along DMIC, ADKIC and DWPE in NCR), 7% national agricultural exports, 60% of national Basmati
                        rice export, 67% cars, 60% motorbikes, 50% tractors and 50% refrigerators produced in India. Faridabad has been described as eighth fastest growing city in the world and third most in India by City Mayors Foundation survey. In
                        services, Gurugram ranks number 1 in India in IT growth rate and existing technology infrastructure, and number 2 in startup ecosystem, innovation and livability.
                        <br>
                        <br>Haryana is predominantly an agriculture economy with preponderance of wheat, rice, bajra, mustard, sugarcane and cotton. In the recent years, commercial orientation of the state agriculture is more associated with mustard,
                        vegetables, fruits etc. and the area under pluses has declined considerably. The annual compound growth rate of cereals production in the country for the period 1966-67 to 2010-11 has been estimated at 2 per cent. However for the
                        same period, production of pluses increased at a much lower annual compound growth rate of 1 per cent. Among the cereals the annual compound growth rates for fine cereals, viz. wheat and rice are 3.7 per cent and 2.4 per cent while
                        for coarse cereals, viz. bajra and jowar the growth rates are 1.4 per cent and -0.76 per cent for the same period respectively. These changes in cropping pattern have especially marked in the regions which have witnessed the advent
                        of Green Revolution. For example, the pluses production in Haryana has declined alarmingly from 952.0 thousand tonnes in 1975-76 to 100 thousand tonnes in 2009-10. Contrary, during last four decades, wheat production in the state
                        has increased about tenfold, from 1059 thousand tonnes in 1966-67 to 10500 thousand tonnes in 2009-10. Similarly the rice production has increased from 223 thousand tonnes to 3630 thousand tonnes during the same period, more than
                        sixteen-fold. The indices of total cropped area and cropping intensity in the state have increased from 100.98 and 100.83 in 1975-76 to 121.02 and 133.53 in 2008-09 respectively. The decline in production of pulses, which are the
                        main source of proteins for a large section of population in the state as well as in the country at large, is not only raising doubts about the nutritional security but also indicates structural transformation of the state agriculture.
