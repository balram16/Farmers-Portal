                    <h1>Chandigarh</h1>
                    <p>The Union Territory, Chandigarh has a limited area under agriculture. The agriculture land is being gradually acquired for the expansion of Chandigarh City.
                        <br<br>
                            Chandigarh is a growing and developing City because of its importance as Union Territory is the Capital of Punjab and Haryana. It depends on out side help for the supply of fruits and vegetable. This arrangements is not stable. In this context it is proposed
                            to create and convert the U.T. villages as hinterland for the supply of fruits and vegetable to city population and also to utilize the back yard space of the houses for growing vegetables/fruits plants.<br>                            Keeping in the felt needs as mentioned above, the Department has already set-up a nursery near Lake Club for supply of fruits, ornamental plants, seeds and seedlings to urban and rural people. The Department intends to develop
                            the nursery on large scale for supply of fruit/ornamental plants to the rural as well as urban people. The plant Nursery near Lake Club was established to supply quality seeds/seedlings of flowers and vegetables on reasonable
                            rates. The ecological problems caused by using anti-eco-chemical has local national and global consequences, protection of environment and conservation of natural resources are the prime duty of each and every person. <br>
                            <br> Since the majority of farmers in Union Territory, Chandigarh are small/marginal, the individual efforts to purchase small quantity of new high yielding seeds of wheat are not fruitful and farmers face difficulty on this
                            account. It is therefore, proposed to procure the wheat seed of latest varieties and to supply the same to the farmers on 25% discount, in order to popularize the use of high yielding seeds of wheat crop and to get maximum
                            production.
