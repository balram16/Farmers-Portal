                    <h1>Jharkhand</h1>
                    <p>Agriculture is the main stay for the 80% of rural population of the state. Agriculture is their employment and primary income generating activity. The agricultural economy of the Jharkhand state is characterized by dependence on nature,
                        low investment ,low productivity, mono-cropping with paddy as the dominant crop , in inadequate irrigation facilities and small and marginal holdings. The dependence of agriculture on the Vagaries of the rain-god can be gauged
                        from the fact that as much as 92% of the total cultivated area is un irrigated.<br><br> The cultivable land resources of the state have good potential for higher production of horticulture and forest products. The soil is young
                        and has high capacity of fixation of humus. The forest provides sufficient biomass to feed its soiling. However, Soil erosion and failure to recycle the biomass is depleting the soil fertility. Hence, a judicious oil, water and
                        land management is required only that can improve agriculture productivity. Despite the fact that the state has a good rainfall, the surface water availability to agriculture is not sufficient due to inadequate storage facilities
                        etc. as far as the status of ground water is concerned, it is also in the poor state due to little recharging of ground water by natural process in absence of artificial recharging facilities, as a result, the water label in the
                        plateau is going down.
