                    <h1>Uttar Pradesh</h1>
                    <p>Uttar Pradesh is a major contributor to the national food grain stock. In 2013–14, this state produced 5 crore (50.05 million) tonnes of foodgrain, which is 18.90% of the country's total production. This is partly due to the fertile
                        regions of the Indo-Gangetic plain and partly due to irrigation facilities such as canals and tube-wells. Lakhimpur Kheri is a densely populated sugar-producing district in the country. It has been the most common producer of food
                        grains in India since the 1950s, due to high-yielding varieties of seed, greater availability of fertilisers and increased use of irrigation.[5] Western Uttar Pradesh is more advanced in terms of agriculture as compared to the
                        other regions in the state. The majority of the state's population depends upon farming activities. Wheat, rice, pulses, oilseeds and potatoes are major agricultural products. Sugarcane is the most important cash crop throughout
                        the state. Uttar Pradesh is one of the most important states in India as far as horticulture is concerned. Mangoes are also produced in the state.<br> Uttar Pradesh supports about 15% of India's total livestock population. In 1961,
                        its livestock comprised 15% cattle, 21% buffaloes, 13% goats, and 8% other livestock. Between 1951 and 1956 there was an overall increase of 14% in the livestock population. There are about 8,000 km² of water area, including lakes,
                        tanks, rivers, canals, and streams. The fishing area in the state is over 2,000 km² and there are more than 175 varieties of fish.
