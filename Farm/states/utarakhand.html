                    <h1>Uttarakhand</h1>
                    <p>Like most of India, agriculture is one of the most significant sectors of the economy of Uttarakhand. Basmati rice, wheat, soybeans, groundnuts, coarse cereals, pulses, and oil seeds are the most widely grown crops. Fruits like apples,
                        oranges, pears, peaches, litchis, and plums are widely grown and important to the large food processing industry. Agricultural export zones have been set up in the state for leechi, horticulture, herbs, medicinal plants, and basmati
                        rice. During 2010, wheat production was 831 thousand tonnes and rice production was 610 thousand tonnes, while the main cash crop of the state, sugarcane, had a production of 5058 thousand tonnes. As 86% of the state consists of
                        hills, the yield per hectare is not very high. 86% of all croplands are in the plains while the remaining is from the hills.<br>Major crops grown in the state are rice, wheat, sugarcane, maize, soybean, pulses, oilseeds and a number
                        of fruits and vegetables. Uttarakhand has four agro-climatic zones covering six altitudinal farming approaches, which means there is potential to grow a wide variety of crops within the State.
