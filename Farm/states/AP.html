                    <h1>Andhra Pradesh</h1>
                    <p>
                        Of Andhra Pradesh’s total population, approximately 62% or 46 lakh families are dependent on the agriculture and allied sectors. The growth of the agriculture and allied sectors is expected to reflect in an upward economic mobility of these families.<br>                        In July 2015, the Govt. of Andhra Pradesh submitted “Raithu Kosam: Primary Sector Development: Status, Strategy and Action Plant” to Niti Aayog. The State government observed that:<br> The farmer’s income is not commensurate with
                        production cost. Factors like increased labour cost, out-migration to nearby urban areas and inflationary pressures have added to the miseries of farmers’ livelihoods. Further, distress sale of commodities, absence of adequate
                        storage and processing facilities and non-remunerative prices have also added to miseries of farmers over the years.<br> Fast forward, during FY 2016–17, the agriculture and allied sectors grew at 14.03% — with horticulture growing
                        at 16.79%, fisheries at 30.09%, and livestock at 12.18% . This sector contributed a 27.8% of total state’s GVA (gross value added), with ₹1,38,833 crores at 2011–12 constant prices.<br> According to the estimates of Economic Survey
                        of Andhra Pradesh, 2016–17, the food grains production was 156.85 lakh tonnes, and oilseeds production was 24.62 lakh tonnes, an increase from the previous year of 9.09% and 12.9% respectively. In the food grains segment — paddy,
                        bajra, maize, ragi, and pulses production increased a little, whereas jowar, other millets and wheat fell. In the oilseeds segment, the production of groundnut and castor saw a drop while sesamum production improved.<br> During
                        FY 2016–17, Andhra Pradesh had a 28% of rainfall deficit than normal — 4% deficit during South West monsoon and 71% deficit during North East monsoon. Further, in the state, the total irrigated area to gross area sown is 50.38%.
                        Apparently, the crops during Kharif season have sufficient water, while farming in rabi season has suffered due to rainfall deficit, and lower levels of water in reservoirs since December 2016.<br> Fertiliser consumption, a proxy
                        for the agricultural yield, is way below previous years. This is probably because the fertilisers consumption data is available until the Kharif season of 2016, and the distribution of neem-coated urea has affected the consumption
                        of other fertilisers.<br>
