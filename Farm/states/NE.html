                    <h1>North East State</h1>
                    <p>The soil and climatic condition of the state offers an ideal condition for the production of a wide variety of fruits and vegetables. In the valleys and foothills, tropical fruits like pineapple, oranges and banana are produced, while
                        in cold and high altitude areas, temperate fruits like apple, peach, plum, etc. are grown. Vegetables are grown in all areas, the plains, the foothills, in the valleys and on the high hills. Besides fruits and vegetables, there
                        are vast potential for the cultivation of coffee and more tea in Arunachal Pradesh.<br> Arunachal Pradesh with a massive 94% rural population, is the largest state in the North-East India. Consequently, the economy of the state
                        is based of agriculture. Jhum cultivation and Terrace farming are the major patterns that the farmers employ to uplift agriculture in Arunachal Pradesh. Most of the agriculture operations are performed by using animate power sources.
                        In Jhum cultivation only hand tools are used such as spade, khurpi, sickle, dibbler, daw, grass slasher etc. Lands are prepared by cutting down the shrubs/weeds with the help of Phwawrah or spade and sowing is done manually by
                        dibbling. Out of 83,743 sq. km of agriculture land in Arunachal Pradesh, 1.10 lakh hectare is under Jhum cultivation and 90 lakh hectare under permanent cultivation. The topography and climate of Arunachal Pradesh is conducive
                        for the cultivation of rice, millet, wheat, pulses, sugarcane and potatoes. Since most of the farm, operations in Arunachal Pradesh are done by manually or using animal power hence, there is great scope of selective mechanizing
                        by introducing improved hand tools such as improved sickles, dibblers, weeders, etc. in order to reduce drudgery. The seed bed preparation operations should be mechanized by promoting animal/power tiller drawn equipment.
