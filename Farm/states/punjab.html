                    <h1>PUNJAB (ਪੰਜਾਬ)</h1>
                    <p>Punjab's economy has been primarily agriculture-based since the Green Revolution due to the presence of abundant water sources and fertile soils; most of the state lies in a fertile alluvial plain with many rivers and an extensive
                        irrigation canal system.Despite covering only 1.53% of its geographical area, Punjab makes up for about two-thirds of India's wheat production and one-third of its milk production, being known as India's breadbasket. About 80%-95%
                        of Punjab's agricultural land is owned by its Jat Sikh community despite it only forming 21% of the state's population. About 10% of Punjab's population is made up of migrants from poorer states to the southeast such as Uttar Pradesh
                        and Bihar who work as farm laborers.

                        <br> The region is ideal for growing wheat, fruits and vegetables, which is why Indian Punjab is also referred to as the "Granary of India" or "India's bread-basket." It produces 37.83% of India's wheat, and 25.57% of India's rice
                        (2018-19). The total area of Punjab is just 1.4% of total area of India, but it produces roughly 12% of the cereals produced in the country. The largest grown crop is wheat. Other important crops are rice, cotton, sugarcane, pearl
                        millet, maize, barley and fruits. Among the fodder crops are bajra and jowar. In the category of fruits, it produces abundant stock of kinnow. The main sources of irrigation are canals and tube wells. The rabi or the spring harvest
                        consists of wheat, gram, barley, potatoes and winter vegetables. The kharif or the autumn harvest consists of rice, maize, sugarcane, cotton and pulses. Agriculture sector is the largest contributor to the gross state domestic
                        product (GSDP) of Punjab. According to 2013-14 data, the contribution of agriculture and allied industries in GSDP at factor cost is 28.13%.
