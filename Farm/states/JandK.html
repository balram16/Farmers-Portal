                    <h1>Jammu and Kashmir</h1>
                    <p>Jammu & Kashmir State is predominantly an agrarian economy with about 80% of its population engaged in agriculture and allied sectors. The agro-climatic diversity of the State varying from sub-tropical in Jammu, temperate in Kashmir
                        and cold arid in Ladakh, makes it ideal for varied cultivation.<br><br> Cropping pattern means the proportion of area under different crops at a point of time. The crop statistics published by the government are used to denote
                        the cropping patterns. Cropping pattern is however, a dynamic con­cept as it changes in space and time. As stated at the outset, cropping structure of a region is the direct outcome of the physical, socio-cultural and historical
                        factors.<br> Characterized with mountainous and undulating terrain and micro-level variations in temperature, precipitation and soils, the state of Jammu and Kashmir has a high degree of variation in its cropping patterns, crop
                        combi­nation and crop diversification.<br> In general, the Jammu plain has a high concentration of wheat, rice, maize, pulses, fodder and oilseeds, while the Valley of Kashmir is well known for its paddy, maize, orchards (apples,
                        al­mond, walnut, peach, cherry, etc.) and saffron cultivation. In Ladakh, barley, wheat, maize, vegetables, barseem and fodder are the main crops.
