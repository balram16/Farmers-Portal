                    <p>Qualitative increase in crop productivity may be emphasized as there is limited scope for increase in area. Current fallow and other fallow land may be brought under cultivation with appropriate interventions. Zaid season may be emphasized
                        similar to Kharif and Rabi seasons. Crop and varietal diversification may be introduced. Quality of production and value addition has to be emphasized. The outreach of most modern crop production technology may be facilitated upto
                        the last farmers. Region and Agro Climatic specific crop,variety and technology may be identified and promoted. While increasing crop production and productivity, soil, water, animal and human health may be conserved and protected.
                        <br><br> Seed is critical for the development of agriculture. The public sector seed companies have become totally inadequate to cater to the needs of the farmer. The private seed business particularly through the multinational
                        seed companies are making farmers entirely dependent on their avarice interest. There is a need to substantially increase investment in public sector seed production, processing and Marketing. Local seed companies may also be promoted
                        to reduce the dependence on multinational seed companies. In addition to the crop seed planting material for horticultural crops are important. Similarly animal breeds and fish fingerlings are important for their productivity and
                        quality. Whereas scientific innovations in seed industry would be helpful in achieving production targets but it would also be important to preserve and promote traditional varieties of crops and indigenous breeds of animals.<br><br>                        Sugarcane is the major cash crop in Bihar
