                    <h1>Ladakh</h1>
                    <p>adakhi agriculture is primarily subsistent in nature but unique and representative of the Tibetan plateau farming system. Until recently, Ladakhis grew and consumed their own grains, cereals and vegetables, prepared their own manure,
                        seeds and other agricultural inputs, reared their own animals and prepared their own farms in an integrated and balanced manner as a response to Ladakhâ€™s agro climatic conditions. However, low cropping intensity, less productivity
                        and a short agriculture season has resulted in the dependence of its growing population on import of food grains, vegetables and spices. Besides, as Ladakh opens to the world, its traditional agricultural system and crops face
                        severe disruptions. Agriculture has now taken a back seat to the rapid growth of tourism in the region. Nonetheless, there is a huge potential for agriculture in Ladakh, despite its high altitude and arid climate. Ladakh grows
                        niche crops, both agricultural and horticultural, which with an appropriate value added and proper marketing can herald a green revolution of its own sort in this region. Focusing on vegetable production in winters and using cost
                        effective technologies, so as to tap the local market in the prolonged winter season can prove to be very beneficial to local farmers.
