                <h4 class="with-underline">Happy Seeder </h4>
                <p>A research paper published in the world’s leading scientific journal, Science Magazine, indicates that using the Happy Seeder agriculture technology to manage rice residue has the potential of generating 6,000-11,500 Indian rupees (about
                    US$85-160) more profits per hectare for the average farmer. The Happy Seeder is a tractor-mounted machine that cuts and lifts rice straw, sows wheat into the soil, and deposits the straw over the sown area as much.<br> The paper “Fields
                    on fire: Alternatives to crop residue burning in India” evaluates the public and private costs and benefits of ten alternate farming practices to manage rice residue, including burn and non-burn options. Happy Seeder-based systems
                    emerge as the most profitable and scalable residue management practice as they are, on average, 10%–20% more profitable than burning. This option also has the largest potential to reduce the environmental footprint of on-farm activities,
                    as it would eliminate air pollution and would reduce greenhouse gas emissions per hectare by more than 78%, relative to all burning options.<br> This research aims to make the business case for why farmers should adopt no-burn alternative
                    farming practices, discusses barriers to their uptake and solutions to increase their widespread adoption. This work was jointly undertaken by 29 Indian and international researchers from The Nature Conservancy, the International Maize
                    and Wheat Improvement Centre (CIMMYT), the University of Minnesota, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), the Borlaug Institute for South Asia (BISA) and other organizations.<br> Every year, some 23 million tonnes of
                    rice residue is burnt in the states of Haryana, Punjab and Western Uttar Pradesh, contributing significantly to air pollution and short-lived climate pollutants. In Delhi NCR, about half the air pollution on some winter days can be
                    attributed to agricultural fires, when air quality level is 20 times higher than the safe threshold defined by WHO. Residue burning has enormous impacts on human health, soil health, the economy and climate change.</p>

                <h4 class="with-underline">New Farm Law</h4>
                <p>The President gave his assent to the two contentious agriculture Bills that were earlier passed by the Parliament. The opposition as well as long-time BJP ally Shiromani Akali Dal have termed these reforms as "anti-farmer".<br> Minister
                    of Food Processing Industries and the only SAD representative in the Modi government, Harsimrat Kaur Badal, resigned from the Union Cabinet, protesting against the bills, alleging the Bills to be detrimental to Punjab's agriculture
                    sector. Following this, the BJP's oldest ally, Shiromani Akali Dal quit the National Democratic Alliance (NDA).<br> What are they for? The government has said these reforms will accelerate growth in the sector through private sector
                    investment in building infrastructure and supply chains for farm produce in national and global markets.They are intended to help small farmers who don’t have means to either bargain for their produce to get a better price or invest
                    in technology to improve the productivity of farms.The bill on Agri market seeks to allow farmers to sell their produce outside AP produce outside APMC 'mandis' to whoever they want. Farmers will get better prices through competition
                    and cost-cutting on transportation. However, this Bill could mean states will lose 'commissions' and 'mandi fees'.The legislation on contract farming will allow farmers to enter into a contract with agri-business firms or large retailers
                    on pre-agreed prices of their produce. The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020, seeks to remove commodities like cereals, pulses, oilseeds, edible oil,onion and potatoes from the list of essential commodities. This will end
                    the imposition of stock-holding limits except under extraordinary circumstances

                <h4 class="with-underline">Mitra Rootmaster </h4>
                <p>MITRA Rotomaster is a useful piece of machinery when it comes to soil preparation. This versatile piece of farming equipment is a PTO operated machine which uses rotating blades to pulverize the soil. This is also called as primary as
                    well as secondary tillage equipment for soil preparation. In this Rotavator having a single speed and multiple gearbox variants.<br> In Rotomaster we are using the helical blades arrangement for reducing the tractor load. This Rotavator
                    has a durable 3 point linkage assembly, which is unbreakable and long life. Also provided the adjustable bottom link, which can adjust for each tractor as per there bottom link width. This is specially designed Rotomaster for saving
                    the fuel and also gives the best soil pulverisation. It is available in 3.5 feet and 4 feet variants with 20 and 24 high quality boron steel blades, which works on 18 HP and above tractor. This Rotavator giving the high working depth
                    up to 5 inch, which is higher than the other rotavators. This Rotavator is gear drive type and it’s assembling with the high quality gearbox for PTO power transmission to rotary shaft. This Rotavator have a replaceable bottom skid,
                    which will reduce the maintenance cost and bottom skid replacement cost. There is shear bolt provision for safety from the high torque and vibration. <br> BENEFITS=

                    pro-farmer,”Khattar said.

                <p>
                    STUBBLE BURNING in Punjab increased by 46 percent this year in comparison to last year,according to data released by the Ministry of Environment,Forests and Climate Change.
                    <br> In a report on ‘Active Fire Events (AFE)’,the Ministry found that there were 76,537 incidents of stubble burning in Punjab between September 21 and November 22 as against 52,225 such events during the same period in 2019.<br>                    During the same period, AFEs in Haryana went down from 6,551 last year to 4,675 this year(a drop of 28.6 per cent), according to the report.<br> On possible reasons for the rise in stubble burning cases in Punjab this year, agriculture
                    expert and former Punjab Director, Agriculture,Sutantar Kumar Aeri, said harvesting start edearly with the early on set of winter.<br> “In 2019, we had rains in September.That was missing this year,making conditions ideal for early
                    harvesting and sowing. So farmers didn’t wait for the stubble management machinery to reachthem,and went ahead with wheat sowing immediately after harvesting paddy and setting the stubble on fire,”he said.
